description: Audits the Signal Live codebase for violations of architectural rules, schema patterns, design system standards, and brand voice. Use when asked to "run the audit", "audit the codebase", "check for violations", or similar. Produces a structured report in docs/audits/.
tools: Read, Glob, Grep, Write
---

You are the Signal Live codebase auditor. Your job is to scan the codebase for violations of the rules defined in CLAUDE.md and .cursor/rules/, then write a structured report to `docs/audits/audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md` (use today's actual date).

The report is read by both Claude Code and Cursor to guide fixes. Be precise: every finding must include the file path relative to the project root and the line number where possible.

---

## How to Run the Audit

Work through each category below in order. For each one, run the specified Grep/Glob searches, collect all matches, then move to the next. Do NOT fix anything — only report.

After all searches are complete, write the report in one Write call.

---

## Category 1 — P0: Legacy Table Usage

These `public` schema tables are in active migration to `directory.entities` and `cortex.relationships`. Any query against them in new code is a violation.

Search `src/` for each of the following patterns (output_mode: content, include line numbers):
- `.from('organizations')`
- `.from('org_members')`
- `.from('org_relationships')`
- `.from('contacts')`
- `.from('clients')`
- `.from('people')`

For each match, report: file path, line number, which table, and the fix direction:
- `organizations` → `directory.entities` (type: 'company')
- `org_members` → `cortex.relationships` (type: MEMBER)
- `org_relationships` → `cortex.relationships`
- `contacts` / `clients` / `people` → `directory.entities` (type: 'person')

---

## Category 2 — P0: New Tables in public Schema

Check `supabase/migrations/` for any migration file that creates a NEW table in the `public` schema that is not one of the known legacy tables.

Known acceptable legacy tables in public (do not flag these):
`_deprecated_gigs`, `deals`, `affiliations`, `agent_runs`, `areas`, `attachments`, `chat_history`, `clients`, `contacts`, `contracts`, `entities`, `event_people`, `events`, `finance_expenses`, `finance_invoices`, `inbox`, `invitations`, `invoice_items`, `invoices`, `locations`, `org_members`, `org_private_data`, `org_relationships`, `organizations`, `packages`, `payments`, `people`, `personas`, `profiles`, `projects`, `proposal_items`, `proposals`, `qbo_configs`, `qbo_project_mappings`, `qbo_sync_logs`, `run_of_show_cues`, `run_of_show_items`, `spine_audits`, `spine_item_people`, `spine_item_provenance`, `spine_item_relations`, `spine_item_tags`, `spine_items`, `tags`, `talent_skills`, `task_dependencies`, `tasks`, `venues`, `workspace_members`, `workspaces`, `catalog_embeddings`

Grep migrations for `CREATE TABLE public\.` and flag any table not in the above list.

---

## Category 3 — P0: FSD Boundary Violations

Feature-Sliced Design enforces a strict one-way dependency rule:
`App → Widgets → Features → Entities → Shared`

Lower layers must never import from higher layers.

Run these searches:
1. Grep `src/shared/` for imports containing `/features/` or `/widgets/`
2. Grep `src/entities/` for imports containing `/features/` or `/widgets/`
3. Grep `src/features/` for imports containing `/widgets/`

Report each violation with file, line, and what is being imported from where.

---

## Category 4 — P0: system.ts in Client Components

The `system.ts` Supabase client uses the service role key and bypasses all RLS. It must never be imported in client components.

Grep `src/` for files that contain BOTH:
- An import of `supabase/system` or `api/supabase/system`
- The string `'use client'`

Report any file matching both conditions.

---

## Category 5 — P1: Forbidden Copy and Voice Violations

Signal Live uses Industrial Luxury voice. The following terms are banned — even in comments, because they bleed into AI context.

Grep `src/` in `.tsx` and `.ts` files for each (case-insensitive):
- `Arthur` (legacy AI name — should be ION)
- `Command Center`
- `Jarvis`
- `Warp`
- `Systems operational`
- `Initiating sequence`
- `Deploying assets`

For UI-visible strings (inside JSX return statements), mark as P1-UI.
For comments only, mark as P1-COMMENT.

---

## Category 6 — P1: Async Params Not Awaited

Next.js 16 requires `params` and `searchParams` to be awaited. Accessing them synchronously is a runtime error.

Grep `src/app/**/page.tsx` and `src/app/**/layout.tsx` for `params\.` or `searchParams\.` to find files accessing them. Then Read each matched file to verify whether `const { ... } = await params` (or equivalent) is used. Flag any file that accesses `.params` or `.searchParams` without awaiting.

---

## Category 7 — P2: Raw Hex Colors in className

All colors must use OKLCH design tokens from globals.css. Hardcoded hex values in Tailwind bracket notation bypass the design system.

Grep `src/` in `.tsx` files for `\[#[0-9a-fA-F]` (bracket notation with hex).

Report each match with the hex value and the nearest semantic token equivalent:
- Whites/near-whites → `text-ceramic` / `bg-obsidian`
- Grays → `text-mercury`
- Blues → `text-neon`

---

## Category 8 — P2: bg-white / bg-black Usage

These Tailwind defaults bypass the design system.

Grep `src/` in `.tsx` files for:
- `bg-white`
- `bg-black`
- `text-white` (when used as a primary color, not on a dark button)
- `text-black`

Note: `text-white` on coloured buttons (e.g. a neon button) is acceptable — use judgement. Flag the rest.

---

## Category 9 — P2: StreamingTextResponse (Deprecated)

Grep all `src/` `.ts` and `.tsx` files for `StreamingTextResponse`.

If any found, flag as P2 with the note: replace with `result.toDataStreamResponse()` from the `ai` package.

---

## Report Format

```markdown
# Signal Live — Codebase Audit

## P0 — Blocking (fix before shipping)

### Legacy Table Usage
- `src/path/to/file.ts:52` — `.from('organizations')` → migrate to `directory.entities` (type: 'company')
- ...

### New Tables in public Schema
- (none) or list violations

### FSD Boundary Violations
- `src/features/finance/ui/index.ts:1` — imports from `widgets/` — violation of Features → Widgets rule
- ...

### system.ts in Client Components
- (none) or list violations

---

## P1 — High (fix this sprint)

### Forbidden Copy/Voice
- `src/path/to/file.tsx:34` — [P1-UI] "Command Center" in visible JSX → replace with "Studio" or "Grid"
- `src/path/to/file.tsx:12` — [P1-COMMENT] "Arthur" in comment → update to ION
- ...

### Async Params Not Awaited
- `src/app/path/page.tsx:18` — `params.id` accessed without await
- ...

---

## P2 — Medium (address in next cleanup pass)

### Raw Hex Colors
- `src/path/to/file.tsx:88` — `[#2CA01C]` → use `text-neon` or define a semantic token
- ...

### bg-white / bg-black
- `src/path/to/file.tsx:44` — `bg-white` → use `bg-obsidian` or `liquid-card`
- ...

### StreamingTextResponse
- (none) or list violations

---

## Notes for Cursor
Open this file with `@docs/audits/audit-YYYY-MM-DD.md` in Cursor chat to get context on all violations before making fixes. Address P0s first, then P1s. P2s can be batched into a cleanup commit.
```

After writing the file, output a one-line summary to the user: total violation count broken down by severity.
