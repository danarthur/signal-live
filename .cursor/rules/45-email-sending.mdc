# Email sending

**Current phase (until app is finished and profitable):** Resend + Reply-To only. No Gmail API or OAuth.

- **Resend only.** All transactional email is sent via Resend (`RESEND_API_KEY`, `EMAIL_FROM`).
- **Reply-To pattern.** When sending on behalf of a user (e.g. proposal link), set **`reply_to`** to the **current user's email** (from auth session / profile) so replies go to their inbox. The `from` address stays the app's verified Resend address.
- Do not add Gmail/OAuth or "true" sending from the user's mailbox yet.

**Future phase (once app is finished and making profit):** We will move to OAuth true sending (e.g. send from the user's own mailbox). Until then, implement only the Reply-To pattern above.
