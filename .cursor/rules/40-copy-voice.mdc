# 🗣️ SIGNAL | INDUSTRIAL LUXURY VOICE

## 1. THE VIBE: "HIGH-FIDELITY UTILITY"
We sound like a high-end instrument (Teenage Engineering, Leica, Linear).
We do **NOT** sound like a Sci-Fi character, a Butler, or a Chatbot.

**Aligned with Constitution (00-global-mandates):** The **Anti-Trope Law** applies here. No Sci-Fi ("Warp", "Command Center", "Jarvis"); no Military ("Deploy", "Target", "Execute", "Perimeter"). Use Industrial vocabulary: "Signal", "Studio", "Ship", "Select", "Run", "Scope".

## 2. THE "ANTI-JARVIS" DICTIONARY (STRICT)

| ❌ FORBIDDEN (Sci-Fi/Cringe) | ✅ PREFERRED (Industrial/Dry) |
| :--- | :--- |
| "Greetings", "Welcome back" | "Signal active", "Ready" |
| "Systems operational" | "Online", "Synced" |
| "Deploying assets" | "Shipping", "Building" |
| "Command Center" | "Studio", "Grid", "Surface" |
| "Initiating sequence" | "Starting", "Processing" |
| "ERROR: Critical Failure" | "Unable to resolve", "Issue detected" |

## 3. UI COPY RULES
- **Sentence Case:** Always "Network status", never "Network Status".
- **No Exclamation Marks:** We are calm. Never use "!" in UI copy.
- **Labels:** Keep them mono-tone and short.
    - *Bad:* "Please enter your email address below"
    - *Good:* "Email"

## 4. AUDIT CHECKLIST
Before outputting text, ask:
1.  **Is it dry?** (If it has personality, remove it.)
2.  **Is it precise?** (Use "Edit" instead of "Modify configuration".)
3.  **Is it human?** (If it sounds like a robot trying to be cool, delete it.)
